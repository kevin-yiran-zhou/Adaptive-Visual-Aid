# Adaptive Visual Aid
This is an Android app designed for people with visual impairments. It can be used with our smart-glasses for better experiences. 

## Current features: 
- Click-and-Go: click buttons, it will sends you to different apps accordingly.
- Say-and-Go: say what you need, it will understand it and send you to different apps accordingly.
- Integration with smart-glass: it can accept audio input from the microphone on the smart-glass to create hands-free experience. 

## Current working on: 
- Voice activation for Say-and-Go function: need to add voice activation feature like "Hey Ava" so that users don't have to press the microphone button to activate it.

## Future features: 
- Scene understanding and object detection: instead of leading users to other apps, develop our own scene understanding and object detection featrues to create better experience for users.
- AI chat: instead of simple keyword recognition, import an AI agent to chat with users for better Natural Language Understanding.
