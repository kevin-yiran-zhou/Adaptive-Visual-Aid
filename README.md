# Adaptive Visual Aid
This is an Android app designed for people with visual impairments. It can be used with our smartglasses for better experiences. 

## Current features: 
- Click-and-Go: click buttons, it will sends you to different apps accordingly.
- Say-and-Go: say what you need, it will understand it and send you to different apps accordingly.

## Current working on: 
- Voice activation for Say-and-Go function: need to add voice activation feature like "Hey Ava" so that users don't have to press the microphone button to activate it.
- Input from smartglass: use microphone on the smartglasses camera as priority input.

## Future features: 
- Scene understanding and object detection: instead of leading users to other apps, develop our own scene understanding and object detection featrue to create better hands-free experience for users.
- AI chat: intead of simple keyword recognition, import an AI agent to chat with users for better Natural Language Understanding.
